# IN filing scraper

###Scraper for Indiana governor campaign finance

This a scraper to get candidate campaign filings for the 2016 Indiana gubernatorial race. 

It relies on set url's from campaignfinance.in.gov and a list of filing numbers. I hope to automate the process of scraping the filing numbers later on, but no time for that now. Those have to be manually plugged into the script as of now. It also needs to be majorly refactored, but it still works!

*Right now, this will scrape only __John Gregg and Mike Pence__ constributions and expenses from __2011 to 2015.__*
